title: What Is This And Why?
---

I suffer from depression. Periodically, I feel extremely low and want to
vent. Chief among my feelings during these low periods are varying severities
of sadness and anger. Hence the name.

This exists as a tool for catharsis. Ranting is only any good if someone is
around to inflict it upon. Part of feeling depressed can mean you *don't
want to be a bother to people* though. This is a half-way house. The internet
is a great place to get angry because no one needs to listen to you if they
don't want to, but one can still feel listened to in a vacuous sort of way.

I don't really know how frequently I will use this. My aim though is to
use it as a way of expressing how I feel an what irks me when and only when
I feel low.

The site doesn't collect visitor numbers, and I think that is important.
Writing for a known audience is very different to writing for *an audience*
in the abstract sense of the term. The possibility of someone reading this
is enough to satisfy my itch, I don't need or want concrete numbers. Even
less do I want some spread of demographics of whatever visitors this may or may
not get. Knowing this is popular with middle aged housewives who also like
watching CSI and early evening quiz shows might well be detrimental to my
stated mental state. Or theirs.
