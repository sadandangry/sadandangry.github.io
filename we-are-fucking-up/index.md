We aren't doing well as a species.

We're running forward with our heads faster than our hearts can catch up,
stopping only to vent the bile our hearts sponge from the ignorance of our
heads.

We are **knowingly** destroying the planet because there is too much inertia in
our behaviour to stop ourselves. We eat dinner while watching murder and
oppression committed in the name of values we support more than we understand
without even a hint of understanding what *bad taste* truly is. Companies are
blamed for the failures of the people who drive them. Corporations are people
too but no corporation was ever raped, murdered, tortured or went to bed
hungry.

The people scorn politicians when they should scrutinise policy. We wonder why
our favourite colour of party looses while vomiting abuse at anyone who dares
to think critically of our favourite colour.

Nuance was a luxury for a world which had time to pause and consider. When
information travelled more slowly than thoughts and took longer to broadcast
than to assess and analyse.

Nothing gets better but we've never had it better. As a species, or as
individuals though? As a species we are gods by the standards of the people who
gave us Abraham, Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius and The Devil. But none of
them ever felt the need to measure happiness. You don't measure something for
the first time in the history of a species because you think it is changing for
the better. As individuals we are disempowered by the society we
loose each-other in and depressed by the crushing realisation of our
powerlessness to stop it[^1].

"Humans are a social animal" but we alienate our own souls in order to
`connect` and trade insults with avatars we have the gaul to call
`friends`. Friend is a word of nuance. A status which takes effort and
sincerity to earn. Now it has been reduced to a single binary value in a
database. It informs the construction of a social graph spanning our entire
species, denoting and implying our like and dislike of things the facilitators
of our `connections` would have us buy.

We are each sinking into immutable perspectives of the world of our own
creation, unable and unwilling to escape or expand them. We quicken the
pace of our creeping ignorance by closing the forward feedback loop and letting
algorithms decide who and what we see, believe and trust.

Soon it won't matter that we have destroyed our collective sense of reality
and truth because we won't even be aware we ever had one. Nor will anyone
be able to express the problem without arguing over the semantics of a word
or phrase which long ago lost its shared meaning.

We're eating the world in full knowledge it is the only thing we have, and
justify other peoples pain with the numb apathy of a species bored with its
own achievements. We don't deserve our own pity.
