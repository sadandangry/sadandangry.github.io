Some thoughts on meritocracy that have only recently crystallised enough to be
written down.

---

Given this definition, from
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meritocracy):

```
Meritocracy : noun

 1 : A system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis
     of their achievement.

 2 : Leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria.
```

I believe that Meritocracy is a terrible idea to implement in practice and in
principle. 

The idea of a meritocracy, or meritocratic system is often touted as the best
way to *fairly* ensure reward for those who *deserve* it. Academia, politics
and company hierarchies are told and tell themselves to be meritocratic in
terms of how they allow people to progress.

On the face of it, this seems reasonable. But I have serious misgivings about
the various consequences of a truly meritocratic system.

## Forward feedback

It can be easily observed that any system which allows those in
control to define the parameters of success, *talent* or *merit*, will
tend over time to be biased in favour of those initially at the top. It is
in the interest of those at the top to maintain their position, regardless of
the changes beneath them. The definition of *merit* then becomes a re-statement
of the situation of those currently in power.

This is why people at the top of their institutional hierarchy often come
from very similar backgrounds. The judiciary, parliament, upper echelons of
the civil service and business all have an incredibly homogenous makeup.

This is not meritocratic in the sense of the definition above. It is however
an extremely stable system that makes implementing change very difficult.

Arguably, this is a problem with imperfect societies however, not the
principle of meritocracy itself though. It should be enough to show that at
the moment, we do not live in a meritocratic society, where the only thing
between an individual and "success" is their own merit.

## Inherent misrepresentation

The corollary of the definition above is that those who are not *talented*
or *with merit* are deliberately not promoted within any hierarchy they are
a part of.

To create a fair system under these circumstances requires those
disavowed from positions of power to be represented adequately by those who are
promoted.

I would argue that given the potentially self selecting nature of a
meritocracy described above, this sort of representation cannot always be
achieved.

No matter how hard they try to represent those without merit, there will come
a time where the means to sustain the current system will be in direct
opposition to the means to improve the welfare of those without merit. In this
case, there is no guidance for what is the *right* thing to do provided by
the definition of a meritocracy. We must rely on the benevolence / utilitarian
bent of those with merit to improve the welfare of those without. As much as
I would like to believe it, I don't trust any random sample of those who have
ever achieved power in a pseudo-meritocratic society, to consistently vote
against their own self interest, in order to improve the welfare of those
beneath them in the meritocratic hierarchy.

So, not only does a self-selecting meritocracy (what we observe in practice)
inherently **not** represent everyone in the best possible way, history tells
us that actually, those with merit have consistently not done so anyway.

## What is merit?

Now for the principle. Defining merit is a very dangerous thing to do when
it will ultimately determine someones lifelong progression in society.

Let's try the laziest definition: merit as academic intellect. I think this
is what most people mean when they think of a meritocracy. Indeed, their
definition we are using mentions intellect explicitly. 

Now, our current understanding of where intellect comes from is not nearly
complete. For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume it derives from
a sliding scale of nature v.s. nurture.

In a world where intellect (and so merit) is determined purely by a genetic
lottery, it hardly seems *fair* to have a system which rewards and punishes
based on something over which the participants have no control. Humanity
regularly praises itself on *not* stopping people doing things because of
some aspect of the genetic lottery, and generally views selection or promotion
on this basis (e.g. eugenics) as abhorrent. I don't see how a meritocratic
system based on the 100% nature influence on intellect and merit can be at all
compatible with a society that prides itself on not holding people back because
of something that they cannot help.

"Why can't I aspire to be *person of influence X*?"

"Well, because you lost a genetic lottery. You aren't clever enough to ever
influence the thing you want to change, or represent the people who *thing X*
affects. Because your intellect is 100% determined by nature, nor will you
ever posses enough merit to do so."

Hardly seems fair does it?

Moving to the nurture end of the system, we encounter the same self selection
problems as before. Indeed we observe in our current society that children of
affluent / powerful parents will more likely become affluent and powerful
themselves.

How about another definition: *merit as the most successful*. Well, not only
are there a huge number of equally fraught ways to measure *success*, but
there are just as many ways to *achieve* success.

I think that in real world system, success simply comes to mean "those who
are at the top" where top is the most powerful position in any given
hierarchy. We have already dealt with how this leads to self selecting
behaviour, so I can't see "merit as success" being an adequate definition
either.

Further, you can be successful through deeply dubious means, which doesn't
seem fair either.

---

What about *merit as effort*. Those who work the hardest and strive the most
will be those that our meritocratic society chooses to reward.

There are two paradoxes here. The first is that this means the genuinely
intelligent might be bared from positions of power (which they are eminently
qualified for) because they don't need to work very hard to get there.

The second is that in almost any endeavour, effort does not imply success.
It is neither necessary or sufficient, and so for the purposes of assigning
merit is not nearly as useful as it might first appear.

---

In summary, I don't think that it is possible to create a single concise
catch all definition of merit which we can use to create our meritocracy.

We clearly do not live in a true meritocracy at the moment, and I believe
trying to create one which is true to the definition above will be inherently
unfair, and not represent society well.

We live in a practical world, where humans are fallible (and in some cases
down right evil) and so cannot expect a highly principled system to ever work
in practice. This is especially true when that system is, as I believe, deeply
flawed in principle.  Simply aspiring to a meritocracy is a cop out of
actually having an adult, nuanced and difficult discussion about the kind of
society we want to live in.
