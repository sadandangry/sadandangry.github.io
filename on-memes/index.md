title: On Memes
---

This is my attempt to wrap my head around memes.

---

The word "*meme*" was coined by Richard Dawkins. He wanted a short hand way of
describing a "replicator", a unit of self-perpetuation. His primary context
for using this was genetics and evolutionary theory. A gene / replicator /
meme is successfully if it is able to spread wide enough among a
population such that it becomes ubiquitous within that population.

```
"We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit
of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a
suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'.
TYGO DANS classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.
If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being
related to 'memory', or to the French word mÃªme. It should be pronounced to
rhyme with 'cream'."
-  Dawkins, Richard (1989), The Selfish Gene (2 ed.), Oxford University Press,
   p. 192, ISBN 0-19-286092-5,
```

Now the term has mutated (as only a replicator can) into any idea, concept or
fad which spreads quickly in society, usually using the internet as its
transmission medium. More specifically, *meme* refers to that particular
combination of image and witty(ish) or humorous caption.

We know them when we see them, but why they have become so ubiquitous is a
much more interesting question than what they are. Especially in the age of
the internet and social media, they are so commonplace that we don't really
stop and think why we use them, or what we use them for. The usual reaction
to a meme is to elicit a shallow grin, nod of approval (usually accompanied by
a turn down of the jowls), teeth sucking or an insincere and exaggerated 
expression of shock at the "truth" of the meme.

So here are some questions I have:
- What are the criteria for a meme being successful?
- Given the context in which they are used, why are they used?
- Why do certain memes take on more significance for different internet
  subcultures?
- What do we gain from using them? What do we loose?
- What do we mean when we say a meme is "true"?

I'll try and answer these to the best of my understanding, and try and sum it
all up at the end.
