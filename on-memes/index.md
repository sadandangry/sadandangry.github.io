This is my attempt to wrap my head around memes.

---

The word "*meme*" was coined by Richard Dawkins. He wanted a short hand way of
describing a "replicator", a unit of self-perpetuation. His primary context
for using this was genetics and evolutionary theory. A gene / replicator /
meme is successful if it is able to spread wide enough among a
population such that it becomes ubiquitous within that population.

```
"We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit
of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a
suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'.
TYGO DANS classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.
If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being
related to 'memory', or to the French word mÃªme. It should be pronounced to
rhyme with 'cream'."
-  Dawkins, Richard (1989), The Selfish Gene (2 ed.), Oxford University Press,
   p. 192, ISBN 0-19-286092-5,
```

Now the term has mutated (as only a replicator can) into any idea, concept or
fad which spreads quickly in society, usually using the internet as its
transmission medium. More specifically, *meme* refers to that particular
combination of image and witty(ish) or humorous caption. It is this class of
meme that I want to understand.

We know them when we see them, but why they have become so ubiquitous is a
much more interesting question than what they are. Especially in the age of
the internet and social media, they are so commonplace that we don't really
stop and think why we use them, or what we use them for. The usual reaction
to a meme is to elicit a shallow grin, nod of approval (usually accompanied by
a turn down of the jowls), teeth sucking or an insincere and exaggerated 
expression of shock at the "truth" of the meme.

So here are some questions I have:
- What are the criteria for a meme being successful?
- Given the context in which they are used, why are they used?
- Why do certain memes take on more significance for different internet
  subcultures?
- What do we gain from using them? What do we loose?
- What do we mean when we say a meme is "true"?

I'll try and answer these to the best of my understanding, and try and sum it
all up at the end.

## What are the criteria for a meme being successful?

So, here is where we must define some terminology. Memes seem to come in two
parts, an image and a caption. The combination of the two make an *instance*
of a meme. The image itself is then *the meme*. I make this distinction because
the set of instances is larger than the set of memes. There are some pictures
which are very commonly used as the basis for a caption.

These memes are arguably the most successful, judging by the original critera
by which memes are defined:

- They are ubiquitous. Websites exist for the sole purpose of documenting each
  of these memes, their history and pop culture references.
- They are adaptable to change, the importance of which will be familiar to
  anyone familiar with success in terms of evolution. When the same image can
  be used with many captions, it is obviously able to be used in a wider
  variety of situations and contexts. This means that the base image can
  spread further and so be more successful as a meme.

So, we can easily say that the criteria for a successful *meme* (as
opposed to an *instance*) is that it lends itself well to narrating or
complementing a wide variaty of contexts in which a meme might be used. Our
question now becomes: what makes a meme versatile in this way?

Taking some very common memes as examples, it seems the most obvious answer is
for the meme to be an extract or sample from an existing element of 
pop-culture. Memes like "one does not simply" or others which derive from
films are good examples. Other memes which are more abstract in what they
dipict seem to grow more organically from small beginnings. In this case, it
may simply be that because the image is more abstract in nature, and not
already tied to a particular caption or narrative, they are inevitably more
flexible.

The problem of why a *meme* can become successful is then somewhat obvious.
Indeed, it must simply be adaptable enough to be used in a wide variety of
situations, and for others to build upon it having seen an instance of it
already.

Why then might an *instance* of a meme might become successful? Success for
an instance is different to success for a meme. Relative to memes, instances
tend to have a much shorter life cycle. Often jumping into the fore and
then receding as new instances take their place in the communal attention span.
Occasionally an instance might re-surface however, and will likely do so under
the same conditions as when it was first created.

Instances of memes can be created for inumberable reasons, but most commonly
seem to be created in response to topical events, or on the whim of a creator
who has noticed some *truth* which they want to express. The success of an
instance is then a function of how accurately, relatably or humerously it
communicates the authors response to the event or truth.

The topic of truth in the context of memes, and why it arrises is dealt with
later.
