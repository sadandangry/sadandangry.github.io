title: Hypocritical Book Reviews
---

I think that some of the most fantastic, caustic and accurate descriptions and
portrayals of humanity are to be found in satirical and dystopic literature.

From the obvious contributions of Orwell (*1984, Animal Farm, The road to
Wigan pier*) through Huxley's *Brave new world* and even novels like *The
Grapes of Wrath* by Steinbeck and the now ubiquitous (if only as the phrase it
birthed, and not its overall message) Catch-22. All of these works show
the capabilities of humanity when taken to fullest of their extent. Many are
thought of as warnings for future generations (or blueprints, in the case of
*1984*) or simply a blistering lambast of the contemporary.

All of these books, regardless of author, age or subject matter seem to be
accompanied by the same sorts of quotes from the "usual suspects" of
literary criticism. I don't mean individuals, rather, the organisations they
work for.

Some examples:

- "*A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it 
delights*", the New York Times on Catch-22

One wonders if the the outrage is at the honesty and believability of the
events in Catch-22, or that Heller dared to point out the madness of
war at a time of nationalistic / patriotic pique.

- "*I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing;
  and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and
  withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down*"

While I understand that V. S. Pritchett's job is to review the book, one cannot
help but notice how they went in one breath from the magnitude and impact of
the commentary to the cliche of "*impossible to put down*".


Such examples are numberless. My point is that when people seek to express
themselves, and their opinions in the medium of a novel (especially when what
they wish to express will be uncomfortable) we are **so** quick to brush
under the rug any serious contemplation of the subject matter, and rush to
judge it my the same pseudo-metrics as any piece of pulp-fiction.

In doing so, we forgo the ability as a society heed the warnings of these works
by subconsciously consigning them to the realm of 'fiction', defined as '*that
which is not real*'. We willfully ignore the possibility of their warnings
coming to pass because if it is a fiction then it must be incapable of
happening, otherwise it would be non-fiction and so already have happened.

Obviously this line of reasoning is bollocks. But I am scared it explains the
kinds of mental gymnastics we pull in order to lurch from plausible and
impending dystopic fiction to a genuinely and increasingly dystopic real-world
without recognising the parallels.

This isn't a phenomenon restricted to books. The film *An Inconvenient Truth*
by Al Gore was literally too inconvenient for us / the people able to
orchestrate what influences us to be remembered as anything other than
a film!
